.DESCRIPTION
		This script is used for throwing status codes to OP5 based on the size of an Exchange Servers submission queue and the threshold input of a user in OP5 Monitor.
        This script is based on a similar one created by Sten KedÃ¥ker.
		My changes to it incorporates user input via arguments and some more logic to throw warnings or criticals etc.
