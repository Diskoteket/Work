# Get-TeamViewerID
Are you tired of getting people to open TeamViewer to get their ID? I've got the solution for you!

This is a small script mainly used by our servicedesk to get the Team Viewer ID of computers in our organization.
The reason why this script is needed is because sometimes the agents can't connect to a computer with just the host name.

So instead of getting the user to read the ID out load you can simply remote to the computer and get the ID.
